## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**safe-remove** or `sm` is a Shell script designed to emulate the `rm` (remove) command, but in a safer manner akin to the Recycle Bin from Windows. Files targeted by *safe-remove* are placed into your 'Recycle Bin' folder (by default, `~/recycle` in `\$HOME`). Files are removed through `rm` once they exceed a certain threshold and become stale (by default, 30 days). Duplicate named files are renamed accordingly with suffixes `(1)`, `(2)`, etc.


#### The Recycle Bin is only cleaned during subsequent `sm` calls, if applicable. One can automate this process by including `sm --no-op &` in their `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` or other CLI start-up files.

## üìë Usage
|Command|Syntax|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Help|--help, -h|Prints help and usage text for safe-remove|
|No-OP|--no-op, -n|Runs without performing operations on the parameters|
|Version|--version, -v|Displays the version number of the program|

* ----- **Stale File Threshold:**

By default, files are deleted after 30 days when placed into `/recycle`. To modify this threshold, locate [[EXPIRATION_WINDOW_DAYS in sm.sh]](https://github.com/KevinTyrrell/safe-remove/blob/7af52e503544b2c43981104a16d523cda54fcc8b/sm.sh#L25). Set to a different value, in days.

* ----- **Safe Mode:**

By default, files are deleted from `/recycle` without user approval. To modify this behavior, locate [[SAFE_MODE in sm.sh]](https://github.com/KevinTyrrell/safe-remove/blob/7af52e503544b2c43981104a16d523cda54fcc8b/sm.sh#L27). Set to value `1` to require approval per-file, or `0` for silent deletion.
